## üõ∞Ô∏è Cloud and Land Classification Map Generator

This Python script generates stepwise classification maps from two NetCDF files:

# Cloud mask file (e.g., cma_extended)

# Land/physiography file (e.g., landuse)

The output consists of four PNG images showing:

Base classification (No data, Water, Ice, Clouds, Land)

Classification + Proximity (overlay for areas near clouds or land)

Neighbors ‚Äì Ice (ice neighbors affecting water classification)

Neighbors ‚Äì Water (water neighbors affecting ice classification)

It also supports optional subsetting and customization of land classification.

## üîß Features

Accepts cloud and land NetCDF files as input

Optional region subsetting (x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max)

Option to classify all land regardless of cloud cover (--all_land)

Automatically saves all four classification maps in a specified output folder (--output)

Implements color-coded maps with clear legends, including proximity overlays and neighbor relationships
